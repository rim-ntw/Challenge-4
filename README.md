# Challenge-4

# What was the challenge? 
The challenge was to write a playbook that installs Docker onto the local machine.

# How I expected the challenge to go? 
Based on my experience, the previous 3 challenges were not so complex and complicated as I thought.

# What went well? 
This time I was a bit less stressed and it helped me to do everything quicker and better concentrate on the task. I wrote a playbook that works and installing Docker as it been asked in the task.

# What didn't go as planned? 
The problem I faced with the task, when I run playbook it fails and showed "Failed to import required library", but I figured out how to fix it by reistalling python 

# Possible improvements for future challeges.
Simplifying essential complexity, splitting it in the smaller tasks.
